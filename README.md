# RotatingPanelEPH
Code to build up a rotating panel using Argentina's Encuesta Permanente de Hogares (EPH)

A rotating panel structure makes it possible to build short term panles to follow an individual for up to a year and a half.

In the EPH, Households are surveyed for two consecutive quarters, then removed for the next two and later added again for two additional quarters.
